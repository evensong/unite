Simple translator program for generating copies of bishops' orders for non-English speakers
---
## Project Goals
1. Read pdf files and create a copy in a second language with minimal formatting change
2. Create a simple drag 'n drop interface for nontechnical users
3. Lay framework for future extension to other languages
4. Allow editing of translation dictionaries without needing to modify source code
5. Eventually keep language files online so that dictionaries can by synced

This initial version will **only** focus on goals 1-3.
The project will be considered successful if goals 1-2 are accomplished
